# 📁 Data Science Projects – Tabular Edition

Welcome to my collection of Data Science notebooks, focused mainly on **tabular data** — the kind of data most businesses deal with every day 📊.

Here you’ll find end-to-end projects where I dive into real-world datasets, clean them up, explore patterns, engineer features, and build predictive models using both classical machine learning and modern tools.

##  What's Inside

🧪 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Deep dives into data distributions  
- Handling missing values & outliers  
- Visual stories with Seaborn, Plotly, and Matplotlib  
- Uncovering insights that actually matter

🤖 **Model Building**  
- Classification and Regression use cases  
- Comparing models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forests, etc.)  
- Cross-validation, metrics, and model interpretation  
- Handling imbalance with techniques like SMOTE  

📈 **Real-world Datasets**  
- Healthcare outcomes  
- Retail sales forecasting  
- Customer feedback sentiment (tabular + NLP features)  
- Social and demographic studies

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Visualization libraries (Seaborn, Plotly)

---

## Quick Peek

Each notebook is self-contained and well-commented so you can:
- Follow the thought process from raw data to predictions
- Learn best practices for feature engineering
- See clean visualizations and interpretations of the results

## Why this matters

These projects are not just academic – they mimic the kind of real analysis businesses actually need: clear, accurate, and actionable insights from structured data.

Feel free to fork, explore, and suggest improvements!
